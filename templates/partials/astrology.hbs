          <P>
            Astrology or Jyotisha is one of the oldest sciences, which takes
            into consideration the movement of the heavenly bodies and the
            inter-connection between them. This science is that fine line
            between uncertainty and enlightenment, mystery and realisation. As
            Astrology is a Vedanga, it has answers to almost all our problems.
            Apart from a predictive science, Astrology can also be called an
            intuitive art.Jyotish is jyoti + ish, that is divine light
